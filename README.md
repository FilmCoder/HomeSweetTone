And feel the rich timbre of peoples all around you.

# About the Game

This is a 2D  and dialogue-based narrative fiction game.  We made it during the Global Game Jam 2019 in 2 days, with a day and a half of polish afterwards.

It was a very collaborative process. When the theme of the game jam "What does home mean to you?" was announced, Tommy Lee (who came to the Game Jam with the intention to write a song) came up with this idea where the game itself involves composing a song based on who's around you.   And so we defined "home" as where our friends are, and we convey these feelings of friendship through emotional music.

For me (Dominic Napoleon), I came into the game jam  out of frustration.  I had been working on a game of my own for a while with little progress due to all sorts of issues (self discipline, inherent difficulties with VR programming, etc...), and the idea of just popping out an entire game in two days seemed like a really cool way to get a breath of fresh air, to get the ball rolling.  I think jams of all sorts (like NaNoWriMo and Inktober for instance) are great ways to pull out of ruts, especially when caused by self doubt or crushing perfectionism. 

I definitely feel a lot better now.  Even though the game we made isn't going to make headlines, it's a complete game nonetheless and I'm fairly proud of finishing it.  Now to get back to that other game I've been working on for a while... Maybe a mixture of :D and :O
